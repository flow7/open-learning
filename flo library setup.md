#ebooks and online articles
over time I think I have managed a really good setup for my book and news reading needs. Therefore I thought I show my setup to

- manage my books between the e-reader
- subscribing some news so that they appear on my ereader
- collection of "read-later" articles to also appear as ebook on my ereader

## Calibre
THE tool for managing your ebook library on your computer. Download it [here](http://calibre-ebook.com/) - it's kinda ugly, but it works - and it is free.

Plugin your ereader and you'll be able to move books etc between your computer and ereader.

## News
One of the greatest things about Calibre is, it can automatically fetch news from online news papers and magazines (The New York Times, Economist etc) and convert them into an ebook.

Have a look for that tiny red icon with an "N" in it. Choose "Schedule News download" and then your language of choice and the news papers you want to read. Easy.

## Collecting your online articles
Every now and then you stumble across a nice article online, that you'd like to read - but not now. So, you bookmark them and try to catch up later.

Do the following: 

- Go to the [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/) setup here on my server and register for an account, very easy: [Register](http://workshop.project22.org/wallabag/?registerform) and set it up.
	- *Wallabag is an open-source alternative to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) and other [Read-it-later services](http://lifehacker.com/5894995/bookmark-and-read-later-apps-compared-read-it-later-vs-instapaper-vs-readability).   *
- Install any of the [3rd-party apps ](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html)to make it easier, I recommend the Firefox extension and the bookmarklet from the wallabag settings page.
- Go and find some articles to bookmark >> bag them.

###Next: Wallabag >> Calibre:
You can export all articles from Wallabag as EPUB as well - but you can also have it all imported by Calibre, even better.

- [This page](http://support.wallabag.org/kb/faq/can-i-read-my-saved-articles-on-my-e-reader) explains how to subscribe to your own wallabag collection as a news source. Try it.

That should be it - takes less than an hour and gives you a great library, with news and your own articles!
